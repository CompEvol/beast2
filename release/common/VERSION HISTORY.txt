	LogAnalyser now has one line per file mode, and CLI script added for ease of launch
		
	More sensible error messages (in TreeParser, RPNCalculator, NodeReheight, and more).

Version 2.3.1 September 2015
     BEAUti
       robustify (un)linking
	   improved Fasta import

	BEAST
	   support for uncertain alignments (see examples/testJukesCantorShortUncertain.xml) 
       improved error messages

    TreeAnnotator allows lower memory consumption

	AppStore, LogCombiners, LogAnalyser improved command line interface 

	Antlr based tree parsing

        DensiTree updated to v2.2.3

	BinaryCovarion model option to run as reversible model 

	Set log level by environment variable
	
Version 2.3.0 May 2015
	BEAUti fixes
		cloning, linking, unlinking bugs fixed
        more robust templates
        calibrations can be deleted now
		improved access to package folders
        improved import menu

	LogCombiner improved command line interface

	Fix synchronisation issues affecting ThreadedTreeLikelihood
    
	Auto load beast.jar, giving footprint for Mac

	Bug fix in EigenDecomposition affecting asymmetric rate matrices

	Reduced dependency on taxon order making multiple partition handling more robust

    Can keep running v2.2 and its packages alongside v2.3

	DensiTree updated to v2.2.2

Version 2.2.1 March 2015
	Support for multi-gamma-site-model package 

	BEAUti some bug fixes involved in linking/cloning + some cosmetic changes

	Better error reporting:
    - in BEAUti, estimate of relative substitution rate for single partition only caused BEAST to hang
    - check correct java version (8) is used
	- package manager warns when there is no internet connection

	Improved NEXUS Standard datatype support

	TreeAnnotator improved sampled ancestor support

	CLI script now sensitive to JAVA_HOME environment variable

	DensiTree updated to v2.2.1

Version 2.2.0 January 2015
	Uses Java 8 to facilitate package development, thus preventing version clashes with packages

	BEAUti default settings preventing common errors, template fixes, layout enhancements, error logging

	Enhanced package manager
	
	Better error reporting for finding common issues with XML files (such as *BEAST gene trees not covering all species)

	Improved install for Mac

	Over 300 commits for small bug fixes and performance enhancements (more readable XML, better NEXUS parsing, TreeAnnotator fix, etc.)

Version 2.1.3 May 2014
	Patch release
	
	*BEAST template fixed

	add AppStore for conveniently launching applications from packages

	improved FASTA support

	a few small fixes (BEAUti displays of log normal, monophyletic constraint logging, allow import of alignments with same name in BEAUti,etc.)


Version 2.1.2 April 2014
	Patch release

	BEAUti handles multiple partitions more conveniently

	improved package management

	fix bug in *BEAST template
	
	many small fixes (FASTA support, stochastic distributions, *BEAST operator weighting, etc.)


Version 2.1.1 January 2014
	Patch release speeding up BEAUti to handle large Nexus files and handle multiple files.


Version 2.1.0 December 2013
	Support for many more packages, including 
		o CladeAge for fossil calibrations
		o Sampled Ancestor Trees
		o Multi Type Trees for structured coalescent
		o Birth-Death SIR model
    If not already available these will be so soon.

	Support for JSON file format

	Beagle update issue resolved -- no more incorrectly calculated likelihoods

	Core refactored, for ease of developing packages

	*BEAST start state for getting faster through burn-in

	BEAUti many small fixes supporting more packages

	DensiTree and TreeAnnotator updated



Version 2.0.2 February 2013

	Beagle scale issue resolved, resulting in potentially faster 
	treelikelihood calculations

	Treeannotator and logcombiner updated to version 2
	
	BEAUti - use-ambiguities flag in partition panel

	colt and apache math-commons libraries included so not all add-ons
	need to supply them separately

	Support for path-sampling through beastii add-on



Version 2.0.c released on 1st December 2011

	New Features:
	
    Allows resuming an MCMC chain. Handy when the chain turns out to
    converge slower than expected.

    Real time tracking of ESSs while running a chain.

    Beauti allows reloading files, so that small changes do not require any
    XML editing.

    For developers, code is better documented, and only the most relevant
    classes are part of Beast 2 (i.e. no experimental research code), making
    it easier to learn.

    Easily extendible: for example, the BeastII add-on supports multi chain
    MCMC, some experimental likelihood calculations that are potentially
    faster than the base implementation, and a spread sheet GUI for
    manipulating models.
