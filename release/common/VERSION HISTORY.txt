Version 2.0.c released on 1st December 2011

	New Features:
	
    Allows resuming an MCMC chain. Handy when the chain turns out to
    converge slower than expected.

    Real time tracking of ESSs while running a chain.

    Beauti allows reloading files, so that small changes do not require any
    XML editing.

    For developers, code is better documented, and only the most relevant
    classes are part of Beast 2 (i.e. no experimental research code), making
    it easier to learn.

    Easily extendible: for example, the BeastII add-on supports multi chain
    MCMC, some experimental likelihood calculations that are potentially
    faster than the base implementation, and a spread sheet GUI for
    manipulating models.
