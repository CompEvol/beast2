    <!-- The sequence alignment from testJukesCantorShort.xml, after converting to tip likelihoods.
	These tip likelihoods denote the likelihood of observed data (e.g. read counts) given a particular base call.
	The likelihoods used here are derived by simulating reads from a multinomial model with probability vector
	alpha = 0.5 + 0.1 * a + (1,0,0,0) * a (for sites containing an A in testJukesCantorShort.xml) 
	alpha = 0.5 + 0.1 * a + (0,1,0,0) * a (for sites containing  a C in testJukesCantorShort.xml)
	alpha = 0.5 + 0.1 * a + (0,0,1,0) * a (for sites containing  a G in testJukesCantorShort.xml)
	alpha = 0.5 + 0.1 * a + (0,0,0,1) * a (for sites containing an T in testJukesCantorShort.xml)
	with a = 2, and then computing the likelihood of the sampled data under each of the above four cases. 
	Each site had coverage drawn uniformly from the integers in the interval [5,20].
	Gaps are replaced by 1,1,1,1.
