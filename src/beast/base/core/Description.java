/**
 * This is an annotation that can be used to both
 * + document a class at the top of the code and
 * + create user documentation for XML Beast files.
 * <p/>
 * The idea is to add @Description("bla bla bla")
 * just before class declarations of plug-ins. Applications
 * like DocMaker then can pick it up through introspection.
 * <p/>
 * To indicate that the description applies to all derived
 * classes, the isInheritable flag is set true by default.
 * This does not always apply, for instance when the description
 * contains text like "Should not be used directly, but by
 * implementations".
